# MIS310-Midterm-Project
My MIS 310 midterm project was separated into 2 projects:


Project 1: Point system app for Serendipity Booksellers that computes the number of points based on how many books the user borrowed, all in a straight forward GUI. Using if, a series of elif, and an else, the code calculates points based on number of books and uses f string to display it as "Points awarded: {points}". On the GUI side their are widgets created for a text box and buttons for computing the point and showing the results.
For example: 
•	  If a customer purchases 0 books, he or she earns 0 points.
•	  If a customer purchases 2 books, he or she earns 5 points.
•	  If a customer purchases 4 books, he or she earns 15 points.
•	  If a customer purchases 6 books, he or she earns 30 points.
•	  If a customer purchases 8 or more books, he or she earns 60 points.

Project 2: A mobile application for CCSU that uses a GUI with buttons to display data from a .CSV file   
  Part 2.1: Adding buttons for calendar, buildings, and and faculty and information is shown using data from the .CSV file. Logos are imported and colors are added to the background and the resized buttons for app styling using "image.open", "width=", "bg=", and "buttonX.place=".
  Part 2.2: An enchancement of part 2.1 that added additional buttons to the GUI called "School of Business" and "MIS Department" that list SOB departments and MIS Core Courses. Along with the additional buttons the color of the buttons were also changed from lightgreen to blue.
